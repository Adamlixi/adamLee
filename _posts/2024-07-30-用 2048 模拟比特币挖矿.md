# 2048 Coin AO

### Overview

The total supply of 2048C tokens is fixed, and the token model is referenced after BTC. Players need to play the 2048 game to mine out 2048C tokens.

### Project Details

**Technology Stack**

Frontend：React

Backend：AO

**Game Play Address**

https://2048coin.vercel.app/

### Add 2048 tokens to the wallet

**Simulate BTC mining by playing 2048 on AO**

Symbol：2048C

Tick：sats

**POW Mining**

One block every 10 minutes, with an initial reward of 50 2048C per block.

The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks (difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks).

Every 210,000 blocks, the block reward is halved once, halving every four years.

Total supply: **21 million = bitcoin**

### 2048 mining **algorithm**

Players earn Points corresponding to the merged Blocks each time they merge in the 2048 game.

Points = 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 12

Based on the Points earned each time, mint the corresponding amount of 2048C.

**When the player's highest score tile in the Top Tile exceeds 128, token mining begins.**

## How to mine a block

The initial reward for each block is the highest, and as the score increases, the token rewards mined decrease.

When the tokens in a block are mined out, a new block will be created.

Curve：Y = b - kX (0<X<b/k)

Block Rewords = 0.5 * b* b / k

Block Rewords Initial = 50 * 10^12

Y: sats per points

X: points

2016

![截屏2024-07-30 上午11.27.52.png](/images/2048/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-07-30_%E4%B8%8A%E5%8D%8811.27.52.png)

Each time a Block is merged for Minting, the Minting process:

Integrate with respect to y.

When Y = 0 (i.e., x = b/k), a block ends, Block Number += 1, and X is reset to 0.

**Difficult** is the point when Y = 0, which is b/k, meaning the total score required to mine out a block.

### **Initial Curve**

**init set**

y(**sats**) = 24425989252 - 5966289x

1 2048C = 10^12 **sats**

Y = b - kX

difficulty = b/k

b * difficulty = 2 * Rewards

b = 2 * Rewards / difficulty

k = b/difficulty = 2 * Rewards / difficulty / difficulty = 2 * Rewards / difficulty^2

dy = [bX -0.5kX*X] = [ 2 * Rewards / difficulty * X -  Rewards / difficulty^2 * X * X]

### Difficulty adjustment

difficult = b / k (The points required for one block.)

Adjust the difficulty every 2016 blocks.

Initial block difficulty:

init difficult = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + … + 2048 = 4094 (That is, a person can get a block reward after playing to 2048.)

The ratio of the expected time to the actual time for 2016 blocks.

Target Time = 2016 * 10 * 60 = 1209600

Real Time = 2016 * 5 * 60 = 604800

adjustment：

difficulty_new = Target / Real * difficulty_old = b / k

0.5 * b * b / k = Rewards
